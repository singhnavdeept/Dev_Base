# Knowledge Vault

This repository serves as a consolidated record of my ongoing work across **data engineering, machine learning, MLOps, systems, and algorithmic problem-solving**. It functions as both a technical archive and a living workspace, with each directory organized to be self-contained and navigable.

The intent is clarity over volume: projects and notes are grouped by domain, documented at the directory level, and maintained with an emphasis on reproducibility and engineering discipline.

Each top-level directory contains its own `README.md` describing scope, assumptions, and notable work.

## Directory Overview

### Notes
Structured technical notes covering core concepts, design principles, and implementation insights across computer science, data systems, and applied machine learning. These are concise, iterative, and reference-oriented.

### Projects
Hands-on implementations and applied work, including Kaggle competitions, data engineering pipelines, and MLOps systems. Projects intended for standalone review are clearly documented and, where appropriate, promoted to independent repositories.

### Algorithms
Problem-solving practice and pattern-based solutions, primarily drawn from LeetCode and similar platforms, organized by topic rather than chronology.

### Research
Literature reviews, exploratory analyses, and early drafts related to machine learning systems, concept drift, and applied ML engineering. This section emphasizes synthesis over novelty.

### Tools
Utility scripts and small automation workflows used for local development, experimentation, and maintenance.

## Notes on Usage

- This repository is **actively maintained** and evolves over time.
- Not all directories represent finished or polished work.
- Large datasets, secrets, and environment-specific artifacts are intentionally excluded.
- Selected projects may be extracted into dedicated repositories as they mature.
